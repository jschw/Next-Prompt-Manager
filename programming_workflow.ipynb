       "**Next Prompt Manager** is a minimal prompt management tool for storing, editing, versioning, sharing, and exporting prompts.\n",
       "\n",
       "### How to Use\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Login:**  \n",
       "   - Go to `login.php` and enter a valid dashboard access token.\n",
       "   - If you need a token, generate one at `token_generate.php`.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Dashboard:**  \n",
       "   - View, search, filter, and paginate prompts.\n",
       "   - Create new prompts or edit existing ones.\n",
       "   - Export all prompts as CSV or JSON.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Prompt Details:**  \n",
       "   - View all metadata, copy prompt to clipboard, toggle favorite/public status, see version history, export, or delete.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Version Control:**  \n",
       "   - Each edit requires a change description and creates a new version.\n",
       "   - View and select older versions from the version history.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Sharing:**  \n",
       "   - Share prompts via a public URL (if marked public) or with a unique access token.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **API:**  \n",
       "   - Retrieve a prompt as raw JSON via `prompt_api.php?id=...&token=...`.\n",
       "   - Add a prompt via POST to `prompt_api.php` with all fields and a valid dashboard token.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Access Control:**  \n",
       "   - All main features require a valid dashboard token.\n",
       "   - Public prompts can be accessed without a token.\n",

       "### Requirements\n",
       "\n",
       "- PHP 7.2+ with PDO MySQL extension\n",
       "- MySQL database\n",
       "\n",
       "### Setup\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Clone or Download the Repository**\n",
       "\n",
       "   ```\n",

       "\n",
       "2. **Configure Database**\n",
       "\n",
       "   - Create a MySQL database (e.g., `next_prompt_manager`).\n",
       "   - Import the provided SQL schema (see `schema.sql` if available).\n",
       "   - Edit `config.php` to set your database credentials.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Set Up Web Server**\n",
       "\n",
       "   - Place the files in your web root or configure a virtual host.\n",
       "   - Ensure PHP can write to the directory if needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Access the Application**\n",
       "\n",
       "   - Open `login.php` in your browser.\n",
       "   - Generate a dashboard access token at `token_generate.php` and use it to log in.\n",

       "\n",
       "- **Dashboard:**  \n",
       "  After login, you’ll see the dashboard to view, search, filter, and manage prompts.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Create/Edit Prompts:**  \n",
       "  Use the \"+ New Prompt\" button or \"Edit\" on any prompt to add or modify prompts. Each edit requires a change description for version tracking.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Prompt Details:**  \n",
       "  Click \"View\" to see full prompt details, version history, sharing options, and export/download buttons.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Sharing:**  \n",
       "  Mark a prompt as public to share via a public URL, or share a tokenized link for private access.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Export:**  \n",
       "  Export all or individual prompts as CSV or JSON.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **API Usage:**  \n",
       "  - **Get Prompt:**  \n",
       "    `GET prompt_api.php?id=123&token=YOUR_TOKEN`  \n",
       "    Returns prompt as raw JSON.\n",
       "  - **Add Prompt:**  \n",
       "    `POST prompt_api.php` with all fields and a valid dashboard token.\n",
